During my master’s study at <a href="http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/auditory/auditory.htm" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Peking University</a>, I discovered my passion for research and was determined to pursue a doctoral study.</p> <p>In 2021, I obtained a Ph.D. degree in music technology from <a href="http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Distributed Digital Music Archives &amp; Libraries Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">McGill University</a> and spent my next few years in the industry, where I used to work at <a href="https://www.tencentmusic.com/en-us/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tencent Music Entertainment</a> as a Senior Researcher to develop AI music applications for QQ Music (2020-2022), and at Huawei 2012 Laboratory’s <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1PF411T7Tu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Central Media Technology Institute</a> as a principal engineer leading relevant music research/application projects (2022-2025), particularly the <a href="https://news.qq.com/rain/a/20250620A094DQ00" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Xiaoyi Band</a>.
